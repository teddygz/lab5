							<h2><b>Loudoun County Land Use</b></h2>
							<h3>HISTORY OF LOUDOUN COUNTY</h3>
							<p class="major" style="text-align: justify">
Loudoun County constitutes a part of the five-million acre Northern Neck of Virginia Proprietary granted by King Charles II of England to seven noblemen in 1649. This grant, later known as the Fairfax Proprietary, lay between the Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers. Between 1653 and 1730, Westmoreland, Stafford and Prince William Counties were formed within the Proprietary, and in 1742 the remaining land was designated Fairfax County. The Town of Leesburg has served continuously as the County Seat since 1757 and is believed to derive its name from Francis Lightfoot Lee, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Settling of the Loudoun area began between 1725 and 1730 while it was still owned by Lord Fairfax. Permanent settlers came from Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. During the same period, settlers from eastern Virginia came to lower Loudoun and established large tobacco plantations. During the War of 1812, Loudoun County served briefly as temporary refuge for the President and important state papers. The Constitution and other state papers were brought to Rokeby, near Leesburg, for safekeeping when the British burned Washington. President Madison established headquarters at Belmont, where he was the guest of Ludwell Lee. For more than two centuries, agriculture was the dominant way of life in Loudoun County, which had a relatively constant population of about 20,000. That began to change in the early 1960s, when Dulles International Airport was built in the southeastern part of the County. Loudoun County, Virginia's estimated population is 398,080 with a growth rate of 9.83% in the past year according to the most recent United States census data. Loudoun County, Virginia is the 4th largest county in Virginia. Loudoun is known for its beautiful scenery, rich history, comfortable neighborhoods, and high quality public services.</p>

							<h2>Loundoun Policy Area</h2>
							<p style="text-align: justify">The County is divided into four policy areas that serve as the basis for all future land use planning. These include the Suburban, Transition and Rural Policy Areas and the JLMAs surrounding 4 of the 7 incorporated towns within the County. Each policy area has a preferred development pattern that is distinct and will determine the location of public infrastructure and facilities over the next 20 years. Eastern Loudoun largely constitutes the Suburban Policy Area and is in turn made up of four distinct communities namely, Ashburn, Sterling, Potomac and the Dulles Communities. The western two-thirds of the County constitutes the Rural Policy Area, promoting rural economy uses and limited residential development. The Transition Policy Area separates the two and is envisioned to support distinct development patterns that will serve as spatial and visual transitions between the Suburban and Rural Policy Areas. A Joint Land Management Area (JLMA) is an area surrounding an incorporated town that is planned to eventually be served by town water and sewer. These areas are governed by the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors but are anticipated to be annexed by the towns and are jointly planned by the County and the towns. Data are compiled from the Loudoun County General Plan and subsequent Area Management Plans.</p>
